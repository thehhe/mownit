# MOWNiT - Computational techniques in science. 

Engineering degree course in Computer Science at AGH University of Science and Technology.
The laboratory classes were focusing on different numerical methods. Every two weeks the homework assignment was to implement a numerical method described below. I used vanilla Java to code the methods starting with lab3. The lab2 implementation was done in C++.

- Lab2 - iterative methods of solving system of linear equations
- Lab3 - solving non-linear equations and systems of non-linear equations
- Lab4 - interpolation
- Lab5 - spline functions
- Lab6 - least-squares function approximation
- Lab7 - solving ODEs numerically
- Lab8 - solving PDEs numerically
